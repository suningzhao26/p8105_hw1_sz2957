mean_flipper_length = mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)
# Compute mean for bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm

##### Write a short description of penguins dataset

-   In *penguins* dataset, there are 8 variables, including species,
    island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm,
    body_mass_g, sex and year. Sex is a factor vectors including 2
    different values. Species and island are two factor vectors
    including 3 different values. Bill_length_mm(mean 43.9219298),
    bill_depth_mm(mean 17.1511696) are two numeric variables.
    Flipper_length_mm(mean 200.9152047), body_mass_g(mean 4201.754386)
    and year(mean 2008.0290698) are three int variables.

-   The size of *penguins* is 344 rows and 8 lines.

-   The mean *flipper* *length* is 200.9152047mm.

##### Make a scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(penguins,aes(y = flipper_length_mm, x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

```

# Problem 2

##### Create a data frame

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
# A random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
   vec_sample = rnorm (10),
# A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
   vec_logical = vec_sample > 0,
# A character vector of length 10
   vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E","F", "G", "H", "I", "M"),
# a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor levels
   vec_factor = factor(c("High", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Low", "Medium","High", "Low", "Medium","Low"))
)
# Check the tibble:
problem2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    vec_sample vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##         <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1     -0.355 FALSE       A        High      
    ##  2     -1.66  FALSE       B        Low       
    ##  3     -0.370 FALSE       C        Medium    
    ##  4      0.126 TRUE        D        High      
    ##  5     -0.109 FALSE       E        Low       
    ##  6     -1.65  FALSE       F        Medium    
    ##  7      0.249 TRUE        G        High      
    ##  8      0.748 TRUE        H        Low       
    ##  9     -1.28  FALSE       I        Medium    
    ## 10      2.03  TRUE        M        Low

##### Try to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe

``` r
# Mean of vec_sample:
mean_numeric_sample = mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_sample))
# Mean of vec_logical:
mean_numeric_logical = mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_logical))
# Mean of vec_char:
mean_numeric_char = mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
# Mean of vec_char:
mean_numeric_factor = mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

-   The result shows that we can successfully calculate the mean of
    random sample factor(mean -0.2265413) and logical vector(mean 0.4).
    However, for character vector and factor vector, the result will be
    N/A.

##### Applies as.numeric function to the logical, characther and factor variables

``` r
# Apply for vec_logical and compute mean
   numeric_logical = as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_logical))
# Apply for vec_char and compute mean
   numeric_char = as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_char))
# Apply for vec_factor and compute mean
   numeric_factor = as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor))
# Mean of vec_logical:
   mean_numeric_logical_new = mean(numeric_logical)
# Mean of vec_char:
   mean_numeric_char_new = mean(numeric_char)
# Mean of vec_char:
   mean_numeric_factor_new = mean(numeric_factor)
```

-   After converting the variable, we can find that:

1.  The character vector has been changed into a numeric variable but
    with all equal “NA”
2.  The factor vector has been changed into a numeric variable with 3
    different levels as 1 to 3
3.  The logical vector has also been changed into a numeric variable
    with two levels as 0 or 1

-   The mean can be calculated for logical and factor vectors after
    converting, but still cannot be calculated for character vector.
-   This shows that factor vectors including characters cannot be
    calculated directly. Whereas, for logical vectors and character
    vector, it seems with no differences before and after.
-   I think it is because mean function cannot be applied to vectors
    containing characters, for example, the even if we have converted
    character vector, we cannot compute the mean because all in them are
    “NA”. But because logical vector can be translated to 0(FALSE) or
    1(TRUE), that can be calculated.
